<p>In this Project I created a Dummy Website as the part of our course requirements at Confederation College. Here we created a website showing smooth navigation amonst the pages.<br>
The initial page here displayed the informtion about the organization, second page we biult for signing up if the user is not having and account on the organizations website.<br> or else if already a user then they can just sign in into their account.
The third page was for Survey to be done by the users which we took up inorder to gather information about peoples choices to better work in fulfilling customer needs by an organization.</p>
